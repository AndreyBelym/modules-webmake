commonjs-webbuild --- Bundle CommonJS modules for browser

http://www.commonjs.org/
http://www.commonjs.org/specs/modules/1.0/

At the time tested only with node

Usage:

var webbuild = require('path/to/webbuild');
webbuild(input, output, callback);

input - path to javascript file, not module itself, but within this file
	you require and make use of modules that need to be bundled
output - output script filename
callback - called after build is done

See test/all.js for working example.

TODO:
- Support for top-level modules
- Support for Narwhal and Rhino
- Better, error free require calls lookup
