commonjs-webbuild --- Bundle CommonJS modules for browser

http://www.commonjs.org/
http://www.commonjs.org/specs/modules/1.0/

At the time works only with node.js

It's published on npm:
npm install webbuild

Usage:

var webbuild = require('webbuild');
webbuild(input, output, callback);

input - path to your javascript program. Doesn't have to be module itself,
	within this file you work with modules you need. Webbuild will read what
	modules you've required and would bundle them with their dependencies and
	program code into output file.
output - output script filename
callback - called after build is done

See test/all.js for working example.

TODO:
- Support for top-level modules
- Support for Narwhal and Rhino
- Better, error free require calls lookup
